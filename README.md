# Mixxer Vibe Coding

A beginner-friendly pygame workshop framework designed for 16-year-old students with little to no coding experience. This repository contains reference materials, templates, and guidelines to help students build their first game within a 45-minute timeframe.

## Project Overview

Mixxer/Vibe Coding leverages Cline AI assistance to provide guided, question-based learning that builds student confidence while creating a functional game. The workshop is designed to be completed within a strict 45-minute timeframe.

## Repository Structure

### Reference Materials (`ref/`)
- Design process guidelines
- Sprite creation tutorials
- System prompt templates
- Timeline management recommendations
- Project structure guidance
- Additional challenge ideas

### Templates (`templates/`)
- Basic pygame game templates
- Starter code for different game types

### Documentation (`memory-bank/`)
- Project requirements and goals
- Technical approach and constraints
- Educational methodology

## Educational Approach

- **Question-driven learning**: Guide students through the game design process with thoughtful questions
- **Progressive complexity**: Start with simple concepts and build gradually
- **Visual feedback priority**: Ensure every code change produces visible results
- **Time-conscious approach**: Structured to fit within a strict 45-minute timeframe
- **Confidence building**: Focus on achievable milestones with immediate feedback

## Getting Started

1. Review the reference materials in the `ref/` folder
2. Explore the basic game template in `templates/basic_game.py`
3. Use the question frameworks and Cline rules to guide students through the game development process

## Time Management

- **First 10 minutes**: Game concept discussion and setup
- **Next 15 minutes**: Player character implementation and movement mechanics
- **Next 15 minutes**: Game objectives and win/lose conditions
- **Final 5 minutes**: Visual polish and testing
