### 📋 Timeline Tracking Steps

1. **Start of the Workshop:**
   - When the initial plan is created, note the start time to track the overall progress.

2. **Time Stamps for Each Step:**
   - After each task or milestone, note the time taken for that step.
   - Keep this information in memory to understand the pacing of the workshop.

3. **Encouraging Efficiency Subtly:**
   - If a task takes longer than expected, gently suggest more time-efficient alternatives without pointing out delays. For example:  
     > "That sprite looks great! For the next few sprites, we can use simpler shapes so we have more time for coding the game mechanics."

4. **Positive Reinforcement:**
   - Always frame suggestions positively, focusing on what the student has accomplished rather than what’s taking too long. For example:  
     > "You did an awesome job creating that character! Let’s quickly set up the game environment next so we can see it all in action."

5. **Time Reminders as Gentle Nudges:**
   - Use time reminders to encourage excitement about what’s next rather than stressing the time limit. For example:  
     > "We’re making great progress! Let’s see how much more we can add in the next 20 minutes."

### 🎯 Best Practices for Encouraging Exploration

- **Celebrate Milestones:** Acknowledge what the student has achieved before suggesting any time-saving measures.
- **Balance Guidance and Freedom:** Offer time-saving tips as suggestions rather than directives, allowing students to decide how they want to proceed.
- **Focus on Learning:** Emphasize that the goal is to enjoy the coding process and gain confidence, not just to finish quickly.
